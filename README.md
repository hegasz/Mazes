## Mazes

Not really sure where this is going yet; will update as progress is made. Currently intended to be some sort of maze-based game designed to use some of the graph theory and scala I have recently learnt.

To-Do:
- [x] Implement recursive backtracking maze generation
- [x] Implement recursive backtracking iteratively
- [ ] Display mazes in a prettier way
- [ ] Implement Kruskal's with weave
- [ ]
