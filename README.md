## Mazes

Not really sure where this is going yet; will update as progress is made. Currently intended to be some sort of maze-based game designed to use some of the graph theory and scala I have recently learnt.

To-Do:
- [x] Implement recursive backtracking maze generation
- [x] Implement recursive backtracking iteratively
- [x] Display mazes in a prettier way
- [ ] Implement Kruskal's with weave
- [ ] Add try-catch to all actions to increase safety
- [ ] Add pop up box for if you want maze dimensions more than slider
- [ ] Add maze construction animation
- [x] Add player that can move around
- [x] Add start and end tiles
- [x] Add win screen when end reached with possibility to restart or create a new maze
- [ ] Add time limit for solving maze (toggleable?)
- [ ] Add either help button or a stackpane overlay with instructions that fades away.
- [ ] Add another maze generation algorithm
