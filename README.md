#### Generate random mazes of any size, watch their construction, and then move a player around to solve them.


Select maze size and generation algorithm you want:

Watch the maze be constructed using algorithms such as randomised Recursive Backtracking:

Or a randomised version of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm:

Then navigate around the maze with either of two different movement types:
